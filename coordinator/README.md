This repository contains the source code for a Charmed Operator that drives [Tempo] on Kubernetes. It is destined to work together with [tempo-worker-k8s](https://charmhub.io/tempo-worker-k8s) to deploy and operate Tempo, a distributed tracing backend backed by Grafana. See [Tempo HA documentation](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/charmed-tempo-ha/15531) for more details.

## Usage

Assuming you have access to a bootstrapped Juju controller on Kubernetes, you can:

```bash
$ juju deploy tempo-coordinator-k8s # --trust (use when cluster has RBAC enabled)
```

See [Deploy Tempo on top of COS-Lite](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/tutorial-deploy-tempo-ha-on-top-of-cos-lite/15489) for the full tutorial.

## OCI Images

This charm, by default, deploys `ubuntu/nginx:1.24-24.04_beta` and `nginx/nginx-prometheus-exporter:1.1.0`.
