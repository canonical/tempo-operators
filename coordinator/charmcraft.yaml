    interface: cross_model_mesh
    description: |
      Allow cross-model applications to make HTTP requests to Tempo via the service mesh.
      This relation provides additional data required by the service mesh to create cross-model authorization policies.

      To use this relation, you must also have either the `service-mesh` relation in place (e.g. to an istio-beacon charm) OR
      have the istio-beacon charm be configured to put the whole model on the mesh (via its config option).

requires:

    interface: tracing
    description: |
      Integration to enable Tempo to send its own workload traces to another Tempo instance.

  ingress:
    optional: true
    interface: traefik_route
    description: |
      Ingress integration for Tempo server and Tempo receiver endpoints,
      so that cross-model workloads can send their traces to Tempo through the ingress.
      Uses `traefik_route` to open ports on Traefik host for tracing ingesters.
  istio-ingress:
    optional: true
    interface: istio_ingress_route
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Ingress integration for Tempo server and Tempo receiver endpoints,
      so that cross-model workloads can send their traces to Tempo through the ingress.
      Uses `istio_ingress_route` to open ports on `istio-ingress-k8s` host for tracing ingesters.
  certificates:
    optional: true
    interface: tls-certificates
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Certificate and key files for securing Tempo internal and external
      communications with TLS.
  send-remote-write:

  catalogue:
    optional: true
    interface: catalogue
    description: |
      Integration to help users discover Tempo's UI, providing visibility into Tempo's cluster members and their health status.
  service-mesh:
    limit: 1
    interface: service_mesh
    description: |
      Subscribe this charm into a service mesh and create the necessary authorization policies.
      This relation is a pre-requisite for using the `provide-cmr-mesh` relation, unless the istio-beacon charm is
      set to `model-on-mesh=true`.
  require-cmr-mesh:
    interface: cross_model_mesh
    description: |
      Allow a cross-model application access to Tempo via the service mesh.
      This relation provides additional data required by the service mesh to enforce cross-model authorization policies.
